                    <p>1.Due to outbreak of pandemic Covid-19 virus, there is severe disruption in the normal working of almost all sectors of economy including functioning of the Income Tax Department. In such a scenario, the applications filed by the payees u/s 195 and 197 of the Act for lowerornil rate of deduction of TDS and
                        _
                        by buyers/licensees/lessees u/s 206C (9) of the Act for lowerrate of collection of TCS for F.Y. 2019-20, may not be attended in a timely manner by the TDS-Assessing Officers. This may cause genuine hardship to the payees and buyers/licensees/lessees who have raised the invoice in FY 2019-20 but have not received the paymentfor the sametill date. As payees and buyers/licensees/lessees were not able to intimate the rate of deduction/collection on such amount to the payer and seller/licensor/essor, this has created uncertainty about the rate at which the tax is to be deducted/collected by the payer and seller/licensor/lessor at the time of crediting/debiting the amountin his books of account for FY 2019-20.
                        </p>
                        <p>2. Considering the constraints of the Field Officers in disposing of the pending applications for lower or nil rate of TDS/TCS for FY 2019-20 andto mitigate hardships of payees and buyers/licensees/lessees, the CBDT issues following directions/clarifications by exercise ofits powers u/s 119 of the Act.</p>
                        <p>3. In all the cases where assessees (payees or buyers/licensees/lessees) have timely filed application for lower or nil deduction of TDS/TCS on the TRACESPortal for F.Y.2019-20 and such applications are pending for disposal as on date, the applicant shall intimate, vide an e-mail addressed to the Assessing Officer concerned, the pendency of such applications for FY 2019-20 for the lower/nil deduction/collection</p>
                        <p>4. The Assessing Officer shall dispose of the applications by 27.04.2020 and communicate to the applicant regarding the issuance/rejection of certificate vide email. The certificate issued for lower/nil rate TDS or lower TCS shall be applicable for the amount credited/debited during the FY 2019-20 after the date of making of application u/s 195,197 or 206C(9) but remained unpaid or not receivedtill the date of issuance of the certificate by the Assessing Officer.</p>
